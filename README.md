# Hand-written-digit-prediction--claassification-analysis
Handwritten Digit Prediction, or Digit Classification, is like training a computer to read and understand handwritten numbers, similar to how we recognize them ourselves. Imagine you have a bunch of pictures, each showing a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. The goal is to teach the computer how to look at these pictures and figure out which digit is in each one. We split our pictures into two groups: one set to teach the computer (training set) and another to test its skills (testing set).We choose a smart method, like a special problem-solving recipe, for the computer to learn the patterns and differences in the pictures. As it learns, we guide it by telling whether its guesses are right or wrong. Once it masters this skill, we give it new pictures it hasn't seen during training, and it tries its best to guess the correct digit. We check its guesses to see how well it's doing, using simple checks to see if it's getting the numbers correct. This project helps us build a computer that can recognize handwritten digits, which has practical uses like reading postal codes or helping computers understand our handwriting. It's like teaching the computer to read your handwriting.
